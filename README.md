## AI Assistant Project ##
This project is a web-based AI Assistant developed to showcase the power and flexibility of prompt engineering. It has been built with Python, Flask, and the Google Gemini AP. This application allows users to perform a variety of tasks by selecting from carefully crafted prompts that guide the AI's response.

## Features ##
There are three Core Functions: The AI Assistant is equipped with three distinct capabilities:

- Question Answering: Get quick facts, detailed explanations, or fun facts on any topic.

- Text Summarization: Condense long articles into brief overviews, key bullet points, or a single "TL;DR" sentence.

- Creative Content Generation: Generate poems, brainstorm story ideas, or create marketing taglines.
  
The other features are mentioned below:

- Dynamic Prompt Selection: For each function, users can choose from three different prompt styles, allowing them to control the tone, format, and specificity of the AI's response.

- Interactive Web Interface: A clean and user-friendly web UI built with Flask makes it easy for anyone to use the assistant.

- Feedback Loop: A built-in feedback mechanism allows users to rate the helpfulness of responses, and this data is logged for future analysis to improve prompt design.

## Tech Stack ##
